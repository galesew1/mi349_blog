            <h2>Why <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is the best example of effective storytelling in a video game.</h2>
            <p><em>Red dead Redemption 2</em> is a video game released in 2018 and has one of the most elaborate stories of any video game. Every side quest, random encounter, and main story mission has a unique effect on the story and dialogue between characters. One of the most interesting parts of this game is the campsites. In the game, the campsites are a homebase for your character to recover health and stamina. The campsites are also where all the side characters live and will constantly interact with you or other side characters. They will discuss what happened from previous missions, talk about their backstory, and have random dialogue about events that took place without you. This is a detail that helps create a more realistic story and creates a deeper attachment to all the characters within the game. The main story is easily the strongest part of the entire game. Every chapter feels like it could be its own game (there are 6) with their own unique plot. What I also like is the character development between chapters. After every mission you can see the impact of your actions weigh on every character which changes them for better or worse. Overall, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is one of my favorite games of all time and a perfect example of effective storytelling in video games.

            <h2> Why I think <em>Fallout 76</em> Failed.</h2>
            <p><em>Fallout 76</em> is an online multiplayer game released in 2018. Fallout is one of my favorite video game series and I always wanted to experience the game with my friends. In 2018, I was very excited to play this game and gathered a group of friends to experience the game at launch. However, the game was a massive disappointment to what my expectations were. The entire world was lifeless and boring, the quests became repetitive only hours into the game, and the online servers were not able to support a small group of people at once. The lifeless environment made it so the only interactions you would have been with monsters or other online players trying to hunt you down for loot. This led to an annoying experience that drove myself and my friends away from the game for weeks. When we returned to the game, the only players left were people who never stopped playing the game. This meant they were higher level and had better gear than people who have not played the game as much. Simple things like building a base for me and my friends became an impossible task since a group of 4 players could not defeat one high level player. That was the last straw that drove me away from the game for good. I have seen that Bethesda Softworks have updated the game and attempted to fix the major problems, but many players will never return to the game again because of the lack of balancing and a horrible launch. That is why I think <em>Fallout 76</em> failed and will forever be known as one of the biggest video game let downs.
