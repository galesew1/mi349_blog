            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Galesewicz. I created this site for my MI 349 class. I wanted to have a theme with my two posts so i decided to write some of my thoughts on video games i enjoyed or did not enjoy. I have been playing games my whole life and they have become a way to interact with friends across the US. I have also been able to meet a lot of great people through video games that I would not have been able to otherwise. Video games have become something more than simple games so that is why I want to become a part of this industry that has entertained me my whole life.  </p>
